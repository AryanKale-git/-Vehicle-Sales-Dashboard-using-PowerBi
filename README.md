# -Vehicle-Sales-Dashboard-using-PowerBi

Developed a detailed car sales dashboard using Power Bi, showcasing my advanced analytical skills. The dashboard analyzes sales data across various car companies, visualizing key metrics such as sales trends, performance by company, and regional distribution. By integrating diverse data sources, I created interactive visualizations that highlight differences in sales performance between companies and uncover insights into market dynamics.

With features like dynamic filters and drill-down capabilities, users can explore data across different car brands, models, and regions, enabling a deeper understanding of sales patterns and customer preferences. This project demonstrates my ability to turn complex data into actionable insights, supporting strategic decision-making and enhancing business intelligence in the automotive sector.
